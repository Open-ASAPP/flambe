### Filing an issue (Bug or Enhancement)

Please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/asappresearch/flambe/issues).

Please follow the templates shown when you click on “New Issue.”

### Fixing a bug (PR, etc.)

Open an issue for the bug if one doesn’t exist already. To create a PR, you must first fork the repository and apply your changes to the fork. When addressing a particular issue, please follow the naming convention: issue-###_short-desc_github-handle, using the issue number for the relevant bug. Your PR will be reviewed, merged, and ultimately included in a future release (see next section).

If your bug fix does not follow our style and contribution guidelines, you will have to make the necessary changes before we can accept the PR. Further, you can expect at least 1-2 reviews from the flambé team where we will check for code quality.

### Release Cycle

We aim to release patches at least once a week, but currently follow no other regular cycles or sprint schedules.
