# Contribute

We aim to foster a healthy, inclusive, organized and efficient community around the Flambé project. We believe prioritizing responsiveness, thoroughness and helping others along with following best practices GitHub issue tracking, and our own state of the art model tracking will help us achieve the shared goal of making Flambé as helpful as possible to the research community. Below we outline what’s involved in different aspects of contribution.

### Filing an issue (Bug or Enhancement)

Please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/asappresearch/flambe/issues).

Please follow the templates shown when you click on “New Issue.”

### Fixing a bug (PR, etc.)

Open an issue for the bug if one doesn’t exist already. Then start working on your own branch off of dev with the following naming convention: issue-###_short-desc_github-handle, using the issue number for the relevant bug. Once you have finished your work on your own branch (and ideally added new tests to catch the bug!), you can open a PR to dev. The PR will be reviewed and merged, and ultimately included in a future release (see next section).

If your bug fix does not follow our style and contribution guidelines, you will have to make the necessary changes before we can accept the PR. Further, you can expect at least 1-2 reviews from the flambé team where we will check for code quality.
