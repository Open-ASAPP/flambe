    Searchable are at the core of FlambÃ©. They are the inputs to both

    - ``step``: executes computation in steps. Returns a boolean
        indicating whether execution should continue or end.
    - ``metric``: returns a float used to compare different tasks's
        performance. A higher number should mean better.
