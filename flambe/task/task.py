    Tasks are at the core of FlambÃ©. They are the inputs to both
    the ``Search`` and ``Experiment`` objects. A task can implemented
    with two simple methods:

    - ``run``: executes computation in steps. Returns a boolean
        indicating whether execution should continue or end.
    - ``metric``: returns a float used to compare different tasks's
        performance. A higher number should mean better.

        When used in an experiment, this computational step should
        be on the order of tens of seconds to about 10 minutes of work
        on your intended hardware; checkpoints will be performed in
        between calls to run, and resources or search algorithms will
        be updated. If you want to run everything all at once, make
        sure a single call to run does all the work and return False.
